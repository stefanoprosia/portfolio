    <h2 class="tena">About Me</h2>
    <img class="me links img-flex xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-3" src="images/me.jpg" alt="Me" align="right"/>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid, I always loved to colour and draw. But at that age you never think about doing that for the rest of your life, because what kid doesn’t like to colour and draw. But as time kept going, I started to get more interested in it.</p>
    <p>As I got older, I would draw and people used to tell me I was great at it. Everyone who came over wanted to see my art. I never knew where I got my talent though, until I found out my grandfather painted as a hobby.</p>
    <p>As I was getting ready to graduate, people asked me what I wanted to do with my life and I told them I wanted to draw. I wanted to design stuff and do what I love. I was always told that drawing won’t get me anywhere, and it’s only good for myself, as a hobby. I didn’t want it to be just a hobby. My grandfather told me I should do whatever it is that would make me happy and not to be like everyone else who just thinks about money and success. Because that's what he did and he regrets not doing what he's passionate about.</p>
    <p>So I became a Graphic Designer.</p>
